His journey in the coupon industry started with a simple idea - to help people save money when they shop online.

                                ScoopCost runs on an affiliate model. When you find a coupon or gift card and click on it, you are redirected to the brand’s official website. If you make a purchase there using our affiliate link, the retailer gives us a small commission. And the best part is - it doesn't cost you anything extra.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                This commission helps us keep ScoopCost running - from checking and updating coupons & gift cards to discovering new deals every day. Our platform is completely free to use, bringing savings opportunities across all shopping categories including fashion, beauty, tech, groceries, and more.
